# shivan
Shivan is a lightweight download manager that written in python üêç . 

Shivan supports multi-part downloading method .


## usage :

note : if you want to config Shivan please read otherwise please jump to step 2 .

### 1 - how to config:

you can configure Shivan in two terms :

    1 - where to save file after Shivan downloads the file
    
    2 - how much Shivan must split file ( in range 1-8 parts)

to configure please enter :
```
$   python3 main.py --config
```
* note : configuration steps will ask 2 questions and if you hit enter and leave it blank in any of step , it acts :

    1- if step 1 leaved blank : save file in root of project

    2- if step 2 leaved blank : split file in 8 parts


### 2- how it works :

1- install requirements :

```
$   pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2- to download file :

```
$   python3 main.py <url>
```
